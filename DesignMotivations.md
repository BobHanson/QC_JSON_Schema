## Personas

### The Method Developer: Renata Pe√±a
Renata is a Phd Chemistry student entering her third year working in a QM method-development-focused lab at a midwestern state university. She's focused on producing first-author papers, raising her impact, and generally preparing for an academic career track at an R1. She's interested in explicitly correlated _ab initio_ methods that can be generally applied to bond-breaking in enzyme catalysis.

How she spends her time:
33% coding new methods
33% writing papers
33% running and analyzing calculations
 
### The software developer: Ki-tae Lee, PhD
Ki-tae is a research scientist who works with a research group but is supported by sales of their quantum chemsitry package. He's responsible for releasing software, maintaining the code, supporting users, and generally dealing with the overhead around software sales. He's often a co-author on methods papers, and occasionally on a pure "software release" paper. Ki-tae would likely go into the software industry if he wasn't in his present job.

How he spends his time:
66% dealing with users (sales, licensing, and support)
25% coordinating development, fixing bugs, code maintenance
9% running and analyzing calculations

### The modeler: Mensah Adesida, MA
Mensah works in a small, multi-disciplinary government laboratory that focuses on atmospheric research. Mensah's background includes a masters in Chemical Engineering and some hands-on experience with Gaussian as part of an independent research project. She's often responsible for running calculations relevant to small molecule chemistry in various environments.

How they spends their time:
75% running calculations and analyzing results
25% writing reports and contributing to multi-author papers
