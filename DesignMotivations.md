## Personas

### The Method Developer: Renata Pe√±a
Renata is a Phd Chemistry student entering her third year working in a QM method-development-focused lab at a midwestern state university. She's focused on producing first-author papers, raising her impact, and generally preparing for an academic career track at an R1. 
 
### The software developer: Ki-tae Lee, PhD
Ki-tae is a research scientist who works with a research group but is supported by sales of their quantum chemsitry package. He's responsible for releasing software, maintaining the code, supporting users, and generally dealing with the overhead around software sales. He's often a co-author on methods papers, and occasionally on a pure "software release" paper. Ki-tae would likely go into the software industry if he wasn't in his present job.

### The modeler: Mensah Adesida, MA
Mensah works in a small, multi-disciplinary government laboratory that focuses on atmospheric research. Mensah's background includes a masters in Chemical Engineering and some hands-on experience with Gaussian as part of an independent research project. She's often responsible for running calculations relevant to small molecule chemistry in various environments.
