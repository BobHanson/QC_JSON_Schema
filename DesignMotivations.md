## Roles

#### QM software developer
I write code that performs QM calculations and produces output for its end users

#### QM end user
I perform QM calculations in order to examine their outputs

#### Visualization / data analysis software developer
I release software that can visualize or analyze 3rd party QM data

#### Visualization end user
I want to visualize and/or analyze my QM output with a third-party tool

#### Meta-analyzer / databaser
I need to consume and rationalize outputs over many different calculations

#### Scripter
I run workflows that require passing information back and forth between several programs


## Personas
### The Method Developer: Renata Pe√±a
Renata is a Phd Chemistry student entering her third year working in a QM method-development-focused lab at a midwestern state university. She's focused on producing first-author papers, raising her impact, and generally preparing for an academic career track at an R1. She's interested in explicitly correlated _ab initio_ methods that can be generally applied to bond-breaking in enzyme catalysis.

How she spends her time:
- 33% coding new methods
- 33% writing papers
- 33% running and analyzing calculations

Technical knowledge: learned Python as an undergrad and uses it for analysis and scripting. Does her low-level programming in fortran. Enthusiastic about things like GitHub and testing frameworks, but the rest of the lab doesn't get the point.

### The Software Developer: Ki-tae Lee, PhD
Ki-tae is a research scientist who works with a research group but is supported by sales of their quantum chemsitry package. He's responsible for releasing software, maintaining the code, supporting users, and generally dealing with the overhead around software sales. He's often a co-author on methods papers, and occasionally on a pure "software release" paper. Ki-tae would likely go into the software industry if he wasn't in his present job.

How he spends his time:
 - 50% dealing with users (sales, licensing, and support)
 - 40% coordinating development, fixing bugs, code maintenance
 - 10% running and analyzing calculations
 
Technical knowledge:: he's great at fortran and C++, comfortable with Python. Has a Linux / X-windows-based development and analysis stack. Self-taught enough javascript to animate the logo on their software's sales page. Understands the point of GitHub and continuous integration, but doesn't really feel it's applicable to his work.

### The Modeler: Mensah Adesida, MS
Mensah works in a small, multi-disciplinary government laboratory that focuses on atmospheric research. Mensah's background includes a masters in Chemical Engineering and some hands-on experience with Gaussian as part of an independent research project. They're often responsible for running calculations relevant to small molecule chemistry in various environments.

How they spend their time:
 - 75% running calculations and analyzing results
 - 25% writing reports and contributing to multi-author papers
 
Technical knowledge: Can do whatever's necessary to run a calculation at the command line. A lot of cutting/pasting data from output files into spreadsheets.
